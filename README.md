# RenderRex

RenderRex (rr) is a lightweight rendering library designed for visualizing 3D objects such as meshes, point clouds, and line networks. Built on WebGPU, it offers an interactive user interface that allows
users to manipulate object properties like color, radius, face color properties, face vector properties and more.

## Features

- **Mesh Rendering**: Render 3D meshes, supporting indexed triangle lists.
- **Point Cloud Visualization**: Display large point clouds.
- **Line Network Rendering**: Render connected line structures for graph-like representations.
- **Interactive UI**: Adjust object properties dynamically via the built-in UI.
- **User Callbacks**: Define custom logic to be executed during rendering.

RenderRex is still work in progress.
